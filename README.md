This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Yet U Client

Simple react client meant for interfacing with the yet U server. Presumes that you have NPM installed and usable. The only dependencies are `react`, `axios` and `react-datepicker`. Once these have been brought in with `npm install`, `npm start will launch the client, which is set to target the server's port.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if any of this setup proves problematic
